# C_Overview

### *C is a general purpose procedural programming language developed by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1972 at Bell laboratories of AT&T labs , it was initially developed for system programming and to develop the UNIX operating system.*

### Why learn C ?

* Syntax of some programming languages such as Java, PHP and JavaScript have been derives from C hence learning C helps to understand modern programming languages much easier and also gain a deeper understanding of programming.

* C is used in operating systems, embedded systems, compilers, databases, networking, game engines and many real time systems which utilise the resource environment and low level nature of C.

### Writing the first program in C :-

*Below is a simple program showing the structure/syntax of C :-*

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    // This prints "Hello World"
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;  
}
/* Output -> Hello World*/
```

### Structure of a C Program :-

**Line 1(Header file inclusion):-**
*The first line has the header file which contains various function declarations and macro definitions which are to be shared with several source files, the # is a preprocessor directive which is invoked by a compiler , it basically copies the contents of the header file namely stdio.h and pastes it into our source code.*

*Some of the C Header files:*

* stddef.h - Defines several useful types and macros. 
* stdint.h - Defines exact width integer types.
* stdio.h - Defines core input and output functions
* stdlib.h - Defines numeric conversion functions, pseudo-random number generator, and memory allocation
* string.h - Defines string handling functions
* math.h - Defines common mathematical functions*
