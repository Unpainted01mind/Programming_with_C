# Compliation Process in C:-

### *Compilation is the process of conversion of source code into machine code. C is a mid level language hence it must be converted to Machine level code.*

### A C program goes through the following process during compilation :-

### Steps of compilation :-

1) Creation of source file :-
   * create a C file in a code/text editor
   * for windows , save the file as filename.c
   * for linux , use vi filename.c to create a source file for c

2) Compiling our source file :-
   * the following command is used to compile our source file -> filename.c
     gcc filename.c â€“o filename
   * we can enable different options for the above code :-
   * using -Wall flag makes the compiler generate error messages which is useful for writing better code
   * using -o flag enables us to save the compiled file with a custom name , not using the flag will basically produce an a.out file
  
3) Running the Executable :-
   * after compiling our C program , an executable is generated and to run the executable :-
   * for windows, use filename
   * for linux, use .\filename
