# Compliation Process in C :-

### *Compilation is the process of conversion of source code into machine code. C is a mid level language hence it must be converted to Machine level code.*

### A C program goes through the following process during compilation :-

### Steps of compilation :-

**1) Creation of source file :-**

   * create a C file in a code/text editor
   * for windows , save the file as filename.c
   * for linux , use "vi filename.c" to create a source file for c

**2) Compiling our source file :-**

   * the following command is used to compile our source file -> filename.c
     "gcc filename.c –o filename"
   * we can enable different options for the above code :-
   * using -Wall flag makes the compiler generate error messages which is useful for writing better code
   * using -o flag enables us to save the compiled file with a custom name , not using the flag will basically produce an a.out file
  
**3) Running the Executable :-**

   * after compiling our C program , an executable is generated and to run the executable :-
   * for windows, use filename
   * for linux, use .\filename
     
### What goes inside compilation process :-

A compiler converts a C source file into an executable, there are four phases in which this conversion happens :-

1) Pre-processing
2) Compilation
3) Assembling
4) Linking

**To get all intermediate files in the current directory along with the executable , we can use the following command <br>"gcc -Wall -save-temps filename.c –o filename" , you will see the following list of files:- <br><br>**

### 1) Pre-processing :-

It is the first phase our source code goes through, pre-processing basically involves :-

* expansion of macros
* removal of comments
* expansion of included files
* conditional compilation

After pre-processing, **filename.i** is created which contains pre-preprocessed code which is not like our source code but in the end our code is still preserved.

In the pre-processed file :-

* comments are removed hence
* it contains a+b instead of add(a,b)
* contents of header file <stdio.h> are added to our code, header files have been expanded

### 2) Compiling :-

The next step is compiling and it basically produces an intermediate compiled output file called **filename.s**, it basically contains Assembly level code.

### 3) Assembling :-

In this phase, **filename.s** is taken as input and converted to **filename.o**, only existing code is converted to machine language and functions such as printf() as still not resolved.

### 4) Linking :-
